Ilang taon akong walang work, and wala rin ka confidence mag apply i thought wala na ako mararating sa buhay kasi ako nalang walang trabaho sa amin magkakapatid, pero ngayon, nag take ng risk at nagkaroon ng work, and finally nabili ko na dream gaming PC ko, my very 1st achievement since nagkaroon ng work. Sobrang sarap lang sa feeling kasi mga barkada ko, ang gaganda ng mga gaming PC nila, nakakalaro sila ng mga gusto nila, and ako, never pa ako nagkaroon ng gaming PC ever since kasi hindi supporta mother ko. Eto pala specs ng PC ko. \n\nRyzen 5 5600\nSapphire RX6600 8gb \nBlack Aircooler aRGB\nGigabyte B550m DS3H\nHyperxFury 16gb 3200mhz\n1tb NVME M.2 SSD \nCorsair CX 650w 80+ Bronze \nTecware Flatline mATX Case \n6x 120mm aRGB Black Fans\n",

            "Congraaats, OP! May I ask magkano nagasto mo in total and saan mo binili each part?",
            "I built my first pc in 1999 an intel pentium 2 with 16mb ram 20gb hd and 3dfx voodoo rush all second hand it was ok back in the day it can run duke 3d, wolfenstien, commando, diablo 1, heroes, war craft 1. For a kid in highschool it was a dream come true. Me second PC, well a replacement was a pentium 4 with 64MB of ram 80gb Storage (1 40gb primary and 1 40gb slave) and 64mb ATI Radeon 8500 (highend gpu that time). It can run battle realms, splinter cell 1 and 2, siphone filter, max payne, diablo 2, counter strike, star craft, delta force and a lot more. This was my early college days na i can go sleepless 3 days just gaming. Tapos may PS1 pa to make you insomiac for the next 3 years. In 2008 I built my first AMD build with Phenom x4, ddr2 6gb (geil), ATI Radeon HD 2700, 500gb Storage and really proud to have custom loop watercooling from zalman with soft tubes from my local hardware yung pang sasakyan and diy na LED lights na blue at red, I probably toasted 3 mother boards for this shit but it was worth it kasi this was the first time I was handling sata connectors with more modern connectors for power kasi back in IDE days puro molex. Then 2009 I shifted back to intel kasi pinaka magandang board nun was either xfx nforce 780i, evga 780i or Asus Rampage II Gene retained my gpu and upgraded to DDR 3 8Gb Corsair Dominators, then eventually did SLi with GeForce 9800 GT x2 SLI both 512MB. This lasted me 5 years until I shifted to (2014) Phenom II x6 Octa Core with DDR3 32gb, R9 290 Tri X 4gb, 3TB Storage with (this was crappy) Kingston 120gb Sata SSD for OS. Storage was used for Torrent Anime, Movies and Series. 2018 jumped to Ryzen 2600 but upgraded to 2700 after a few months then after a year swapped it to a Ryzen 9 3900x from a friend, because of work since I do video and aftereffects for work with 1tb nvme, 4tb hdd, GTX 1080ti, 64gb Ram 3000mhz. Today I‚Äôm using Ryzen 9 5900x, 128gb Ram, 2TB NVME and 11TB HDD, with RTX 3080. Instill game but I just play games na mejo luma parin like dying light 2, rdr2, Civ 6, etc. pero I know the feeling of building a computer and just having that sense of accomplishment when you finally get a computer to run for the first time. I still feel the same as what I felt when I built my first PC back in 1999. Mejo mas madali lang ngayon kasi di ka na nag eexperimento di tulad nung early 2000 na pwede makasira yung mga overclocking mo or mali yung primary at slave, or di naka saksak ng maayos yung IDE cables mo. Not to mention na cases today are easy to cable manage. But congrats to you OP.",

I waited 6 days for it to arrive.\n\n\n- Amazon US: RAM --> it's a steal to purchase your RAM on Amazon instead, provided you can wait at most 2 weeks. Mine arrived after 13 days. You won't have to pay for shipping, import taxes, and yung usual na patong pag bumili ka ng RAM dito. You can get a DDR5 6000MHz CL30 kit for 6k whereas here kits like those start at 7-8k.\n\n\n- Shopee: CPU Cooler (Phantom Spirit 120 SE) --> usual shopee wins with free shipping, it arrived after two days.\n\nEDIT: imo, availability and prices are really best online. I think the only notable exception here are CPU + Motherboard bundles that are mostly exclusive to your physical stores in Greenhills or Gilmore but we're starting to see them online now too.",

The explanation per component was also **on point**.  \n  \nOn pricing, when I compared their quotations to others, the price difference was insignificant (some parts were even cheaper at TRB). They also accommodated my request to have the boxes opened in front of me and let me watch as they built my PC (as a sus) - which gave me the peace of mind I sought. \n\nThey have a store in Makati (near Cash & Carry, so it was very close to me when I picked up my unit); everything was processed conveniently through Messenger.

If you want the newer generation of RT and DLSS you can get the RTX 3050 but for raw performance, the RTX 2060 6GB or 12GB is a better option. Also if you can find RX 6600 at the same price within your budget, might as well get the RX 6600.\n\nNote that RTX 2060 at 17k-20k price point is reasonable and within MSRP. A friend of mine bought an RTX 2060 at 16k(cheapest find).\n\nSo in choosing try this: RX 6600 > RTX 2060 > RTX 3050",

It will go into your next build. Get a good PSU (Gold, modular, 500-750w).\n\n  \nSa totoo lang, hindi naman para sa lahat ang future proofing. Para lang yan sa mga trip mag-upgrade every generation. Enthusiasts kumbaga. Yan yung may mga pera talaga na nakatabi for their PC building hobby.\n\n  \nPero ikaw, kung ngayon ka lang magkakaroon ng 40-50K for a PC at ang gusto mo lang is malaro yung mga trip mong games, like GTA V, Valorant, or even yung mga AAA games like Cyberpunk, Assassin's Creed etc., get the best yet cheapest part na makukuha mo.\n\n  \nRyzen 5/7 or Intel i5 + Mid Range GPU is all you need. For sure, kung tight budget ka naman di ka mangangarap mag 4K Gaming! LOL Don't overspend on CPU/MOBO and RAM. Get the basic ones. No need to overclock and all that crap.\n\n  \nWag ka maniwala dun sa \"AM4 is dead, get AM5\". Yung Ryzen 5600X/5700X mo, mas mura yan sa Ryzen 5 7600X ngayon. Pero same lang din naman na tatagal yan ng another 5 years and the performance of the older CPU will hold up over time.. mas mura pa yung MOBO mo at DDR4 RAM.\n\n  \nTrust me, pag nabuo mo yung gusto mong PC ngayon that's bang for buck, you won't need to upgrade for the next 5 years. Kung makakaipon ka to get a better GPU in 2-3 years, why not. Pero wag ka ma-stress dun.\n\n  \nAfter 5 years, baka di ka mag-upgrade. 9 times out of 10, may pera ka na nyan to build a new one.\n\n  \nThis tip is not for everyone, I'm not saying na wag ka mag-future proof kung kaya mo naman bumili ng mas mahal. I'm just saying this kasi maraming newbie dito na napapaniwala nung mga \"future proofers\". Mahalaga mag enjoy kayo maglaro ‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è",

And these cheap people who purchase for crap money, they build machines and try to sell it to people who got no clue for a high price. They put a fairly okay gpu in but the rest is junk 3-4+ years old garbage hardware and sell it as barely used gaming pc.\nFuture proof your build for 4-5 years. Then it doesn't matter if its very expensive now because it will he failry expensive 4-5 years later. And you don't have to stop parts every year but you can just as easy upgrade just one or two components. If you buy cheap hardware you have to replace more hardware later not just one or two. I understand, budget is very limited. Then buy just a mid range BUT GOOD QUALITY pc that you can slowly upgrade to better quality. But don't expect a junk cheap pc take you more than one or two years. And you can kind of completely replace the whole crap in two years.

            "Both CPU air coolers and AIO liquid coolers have their own uses.\n\nFor example in an [SFF Mini-ITX build](https://lian-li.com/product/a4h2o/), it might be a better solution to use an AIO liquid cooler than a tower based air cooler because there is not enough clearance for a tower style air cooler.  Although low profile CPU coolers exist, they might not be powerful enough to cool a particularly hot CPU like a Core i7-14700K for example.\n\nAlso some cases like the [Tecware VXR](https://www.tecware.co/vxr) don't have enough clearance for a good tower style air cooler and are specifically designed to be used with AIO liquid coolers.  You can use a CPU air cooler with that case, but air coolers meeting the 140mm height requirement are few and hard to find.\n\nPersonally I favor CPU air coolers for longevity and hassle free maintenance.  I also buy expensive CPU air coolers like the Noctua NH-D15 which cost more or less the same as a 240mm AIO liquid cooler.  CPU air coolers can last several years and be reused across builds.  So buying an expensive CPU air cooler can be a good investment.\n\nNowadays AIO liquid coolers are getting better and better and some even offer very long warranty periods like 5-6 years.  So there is no more anxiety in having an AIO liquid cooler fail on you after 2-3 years assuming you get one that is built very well and has a long warranty.\n\nAlso with very hot CPU's like Core i9-13900K to Core i9-14900K sometimes the only practical cooling solution is to go with a powerful 360mm or 420mm AIO liquid cooler.  At this time we still don't have CPU air coolers that can match or beat the performance of a powerful AIO liquid cooler with a radiator occupying a very large surface area.  Even Noctua knows this limitation and are starting their research into [Thermosiphon AIO liquid cooling](https://www.techpowerup.com/323232/noctua-thermosiphon-liquid-cooler-prototype-looks-promising) to provide more cooling performance.\n\nOn my next build I might decide to go with an AIO liquid cooler (depending on the CPU) but let's see first.",

            "Yes, Most people dont really need them tbh and theres also the fact that most air cooler design these days are ways better at cooling CPUs (and cheaper) now than the previous models of air coolers and even AIO's.\n\nOne of the few scenarios that i would reccomend an AIO vs Tower coolers, is if you move your PC a lot. Cause tower coolers are just way heavier now (especially the dual Tower cooler designs) and can easily damage your board if your always transporting your PC by car from one location to the next.\n\nAnother is overclocking or if that person prefers a more silent PC build. Cause you can easily & safely set your AIO's fans to run a lot more quieter (liquid temps in the radiators rises slowly, unlike in air coolers where they spike quickly), especially if your using a 360 AIO's which has 3 fans. Compared to Air coolers, where they have to ramp up/down the fans quickly to compensate for the quick spikes in temps. \n\nYou can technically still lower the fans hysterisis to reduce or slow down the sudden ramp up time for your air coolers fan, but i wouldn't reccomend doing it as theres a small risk of damaging your cpu if you let it run hotter for longer than it normally should even.",

            "There's definitely a time and place for either AIOs or air coolers. I try not to be confrontational with spec posts, I just leave suggestions. If someone's budget allows for either an air cooler or a good AIO(for the budget), just suggest whatever models will work with the setup and if needed, give the pros and cons for air or water.¬†\n\n\nConsider my setup. I've¬†been using an Arctic LFII 240 since Sept. 2021. It's working well so far, provides good cooling, and has no odd noises. My current CPU is an R5 5600, with an upgrade to a 5700x3d planned. While the stock cooler would have been sufficient, the water cooler has given me the option to upgrade to a higher power chip later without having to worry about cooling. The same can also be said if I had a good tower cooler. Just consider the pros and cons + your budget.¬†\n\n\nAlso, I don't see many people mention what I consider a good quality-of-life feature of AIOs over tower coolers: The ease of working around the cpu socket. RAM, CMOS batteries, M.2 SSDs, and even the GPU can be much easier to access versus having a tower cooler. Something to consider.",
            " I actually asked this question recently here on Reddit. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Deepcool/s/UwRixLowxM) I didn't know that an AIO was not at all necessary for a Ryzen 5 5600, but people were kind enough to tell me that I didn't need it. I guess people on that Facebook group just don't gaf if you waste your money or not.",

So I agree naman with you.",
            "Yes, an AIO is an unnecessary expense when it comes to CPUs nowadays. The only time you need an AIO would be when you have a high-end CPU. For reference me and my brother only use the stock AMD wraith stealth for our CPUs (5600G and 5600X).",

Obviously, you don't \"need\" an AIO but anecdotally speaking, I've been extremely satisfied with the results and have not experienced failure or any negatives with them except for maybe some anxiety about case dimensions and tight installation. Granted, they are not as affordable, but personally, I would never go back on a non-budget build.",
            "Aircoolers pa rin talaga",

            "Is a 3600 still under \"modern CPU\" or do I need an AIO?",
            ">A cheap 1-2k pesos aircooler is decent enough for midrange CPUs like Ryzen 5 5600, 5700 and even a 5800X3D.\n\nRegarding the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, that CPU can run surprisingly hot even while gaming.  I have seen it reach 90C at times in HWiNFO64 (CPU CCD Tdie) when my nephew was playing games at high framerates.  I was not expecting it until I used the PC for a few minutes and saw the red reading in HWiNFO64.\n\nI'm using a DeepCool AK620 Zero Dark CPU air cooler which is a pretty beefy air cooler.  Although to be fair, I have the fans running a low RPM as I wanted a quiet running PC.  But still I was surprised that the Ryzen 7 5800X3D could still reach those temps on a good air cooled setup.  The case I'm using is a darkFlash DLX200 Mesh with 5x 140mm case fans so airflow is not a problem.\n\nEventually I used PBO2 Tuner and applied a -30 offset on all 8-cores and that lowered temps significantly.  Now I'm seeing around 80C at the max which is still surprising but more manageable and less worrisome.\n\nI think for the Ryzen 7 5800X3D you should spend a bit more on the CPU cooler and go for a [thick tower](https://www.deepcool.com/products/Cooling/cpuaircoolers/AK500-High-Performance-CPU-Cooler-1700-AM5/2022/16040.shtml) or dual tower design.

            "I am pretty much satisfied with my DeepCool Gammaxx 400 V2, which I bought for 600 on sale on Lazada last December. It is doing a better job than my stock Intel cooler. AIO seems fine if you have the budget for the decent one and want your PC to look cleaner, but it has drawbacks. Most likely, it will fail in 3-4 years, requiring you to buy another one, whereas air coolers can pretty much last forever. And PCMRPH is bad as Playstation PH mas cancer nga lang Playstation PH.",

        "selftext": "Well, at least indirectly. \n\nSo, I ordered an Acer Bifrost Intel Arc A750 from Amazon last Black Friday (it finally went under 10k PHP), and the thing arrived last week in a pretty cool packaging. \n\nCard is heavy, looks amazing, and has this unique hybrid blower/regular fan cooling system. Installation and driver setup was pretty straight forward. \n\nI ran a quick test on CP2077 (I read this card does well on that game), and true enough, my 12400 + A750 = 75 FPS average on 1440p Ultra XeSS enabled. XeSS is awesome if the game supports it. The card was staying mostly at 166W (you can undervolt it by setting a cap in Intel Arc Control) so I'm not too worried about the power draw. I'm probably more concerned as the card was going around 75C, when the AMD cards I own were mostly hovering in the low to mid 60C.\n\nThe real kicker in all of this however is [the email I got from Amazon](https://i.imgur.com/7H5TzHD.png). \n\nI quickly dismissed this as a mistake. Surely it was meant for another account, right? My card is working perfectly.\n\nBut no, [I really did get refunded my money](https://i.imgur.com/wi3qh5U.png). If I had to guess, the package might have been damaged during shipment (probably dropped or something), but they didn't want to bother to check if it still works or not. Regardless, I got it in pristine condition and so far so good.\n\nSo, I guess... thanks, Amazon? Even if I didn't win in our company raffle, you made me feel like I did. You're the best. \n\nMore pics of the card [here](https://imgur.com/a/EdN2THM). \n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "#TL;DR:\n\n**r/PHGamers and r/PHBuildaPC will be participating in site-wide protests against Reddit's new API policy changes. These new API policy changes will affect moderators and casual users usage of third-party tools and applications. The subreddits will be set to private starting on June 12th. The subreddits will be set to private starting on June 12th. Our [Discord](https://discord.com/servers/r-phg-r-phbapc-782800744147189772) servers will remain open and accessible.**\n\n#Why is this blackout happening?\n\nOur goal is to make Reddit hear us.\n\nOn July 1st, 2023, [Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/). This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay [enormous sums of money](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include browsers like Reddit Is Fun, moderation tools like Pushshift, and accessibility-focused add-ons for users who are visually impaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit‚Äîthe fixtures which make it appealing‚Äîwill be eliminated.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's^‚Ä† statement, \"[I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-ipo-ceo-meme-stock-seeking-individual-investors-2021-10)\", is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote: \n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access. \n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.\n\n-----\n\n^(‚Ä† Co-founder and current CEO of Reddit)\n\n-----\n\n#How will this API nonsense affect normal users?\n\n[Here is an infographic which succinctly illustrates what the proposal will mean for Redditors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/140z59z/i_made_this_friendly_infographic_explaining_the/)\n\nIn a nutshell, Reddit's proposal of charging for access to its API at a rate of USD $12,000 per 50 million API requests means the following:\n\n* All third-party Reddit apps are effectively killed. No developer is willing to pay close to $20,000,000.00 per year just to keep their third-party Reddit app running.\n* Blind/visually-impaired users who rely on third-party apps to read Reddit out loud to them can no longer use the platform.\n* Moderation tools that rely on third-party bots will cease to function, making it easier for spam, scammers, and illegal content to be shared and discussed.\n\n[I am very much aware that for many (arguably, most) users, this means nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/140yhid/comment/jmygre3/?context=1). If you enjoy using Reddit's official website and apps, and don't care about bots, moderation, and spam, you will probably not even notice a difference if and when Reddit implements its proposed API changes.\n\nHowever, if you: use Reddit via an app like Apollo, Sync, Reddit is Fun, BaconReader, Alien Blue, Relay for Reddit, or any other app; or if you find bots like u/Decronym, u/Paid-Not-Payed-Bot, or u/the_sam_bot to be useful, educational, or just plain fun; and enjoy not being bombarded by spam or scams on Reddit, then this change could affect your experience for the worse.\n\n#What does this mean for r/PHGamers and r/PHBuildaPC?\n\nOn June 12, both r/PHGamers and r/PHBuildaPC will be taken offline in solidarity with other participating subreddits, including r/FilmClubPH and r/Philippines. Any content on these subreddits will no longer be accessible, and new posts cannot be made starting on the blackout date. If you are subscribed to any of these subreddits, you will remain subscribed; but you simply will not be able to see or engage with them. It will be as if they no longer exist.\n\nIf any of these subreddits decide to go back online after their self-imposed blackout dates, all operations are expected to return to normal. Users will not be required to change any settings, resubscribe, or do anything on their end to resume interacting with the subreddits in any way. It will be as if nothing happened.\n\nMany subreddits are following a 48-hour blackout, however some have proposed going offline indefinitely until Reddit officially reneges on its API policy change. As of now, I am currently undecided on when the blackout dates for r/PHGamers and r/PHBuildaPC will end. Feel free to discuss and leave your comments below.\n\nOur [Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/r-phg-r-phbapc-782800744147189772) will remain open during the Reddit blackout period. If you think you'll need help while the subreddits are offline, feel free to drop by in advance.\n\n#What can I, as a normal Reddit user, do?\n\n* **Learn** more about the effort at r/Save3rdPartyApps/\n* **Complain:** Message the mods of [r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/), who are the admins of the site; message /u/reddit; submit a support request; comment in relevant threads on r/reddit; leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app; and sign your username in support to this post.\n* **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join the effort at r/ModCoord - but *please don't pester mods you don't know* by simply spamming their modmail.\n* **Join the boycott!** Stay off Reddit entirely from June 12th through the 14th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n* **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",

Grabe pagbaba ko palang ng LRT Station sinalubong na agad ako ng mga nag aabang na fixer, advice saken ng mga kakilala ko is wag ko daw pansinin and diretso ako sa pupuntahan ko.\n\nYung pinuntahan ko ni-reccomend sakin ng tito ko, pero unfortunately yung services na kailangan ko wala sila (gpu repair, hindi daw sila nag aayos kapag hindi sa kanila galing)\n\nSo no choice na, pagkalabas na pagkalabas ko may nakaabang na sakin. Try ko daw sa kanila, siyempre ako wala nang choice sumama ako just to see kung saan ako dadalhin. Dinala ako sa may parang gilid ng Gilmore kung saan parang mga technician lang pero wala silang store (sabi sakin may store daw sila)\n\nDito ako nainis ng bahagya, bali yung fixer yung nagtatanong sakin kung ano problema ng unit ko tapos siya kakausap sa technician. Sa akin parang ang pangit nandito naman ako bat hindi man lang ako ine-entertain ng technician mismo, plus may kausap pa siya sa phone.\n\nWait lang daw tatapusin lang daw niya yung kausap sa phone, 5 minutes past binaba na niya phone niya tapos diretso halungkat/unscrew sa gpu ko. Tinatanong ko siya kung sa tingin niya anong sira parang walang narinig tuloy lang sa pag unscrew, doon na ako nainis at tinaasan ko boses ko doon na niya ako pinansin.\n\nSabi ko kaagad nag iba isip ko since baka matagal at may pupuntahan pako (that's a lie), sabi nila saglit lang daw mga 1 hour ayos na yung unit. Then ako na nagtanong kung magkano (sa tanang buhay ko kapag may pinapagawa or pinapaayos ako sinasabi agad sakin yung presyo on the spot) hindi kami magkasundo sa presyo.\n\nAyon sabi ko wag nalang at may importanteng lakad pa ako (it's a lie), humirit pa sige daw test nalang daw nila para alam ko kung gumagana ba daw kasi baka daw fluke lang yung sira ng gpu ko. Diretso siya salpak sa testbench niya pinigilan ko agad the sabi ko kung magkano ba service fee?, sabi sakin 500 pesos (para lang sa testbench 500 na?!) so sabi ko wag nalang at ilang beses na ako nag test.\n\nnagpasalamat nalang ako, humingi ng calling card para kunwari babalik, tas binigyan ng 50 yung fixer (sayang pipti ko hahaha)\n\nParang ayoko na bumalik doon hahaha, pero mga oldheads talaga gilmore talaga ang nire-recommend, ewan ko ba siguro sa approach ng mga tao at salesperson sakin iba. Parang pangit din kasi dapat may kakilala ka doon or suki ka na kung gusto mo magtanong-tanongüòÖ, stick nalang siguro ako sa mga FB Online Store.\n\nGilmore experience: 3/10 not recommended lalo na kung introverted kaüòÖ",

Just walk straight and wag ka magpahalata na parang nasa big city ka na lingon ng lingon - most of the times napro profile ka nila as first timer sa lugar.  \n\n\nMakakatulong din yung atleast may 3 or 4 store kang alam mong pupuntahan mo para sa service na need mo - para kung wala si first store (minsan sarado), pwede mong daanan yung other stores  para hindi sayang yung trip mo sa gilmore.",

Yun ngang isang part at batteries ng 2013 edition ng MacBook ko na may 1st version ng Retina napalitan at naiayos niya.

            "Di na rin ako pumupunta ng Gilmore. Ang taas ng anxiety level ko pag lumalapit ung mga fixer dyan kahit may specific na store naman na ako na pupuntahan. Ngayon imbes na pumunta pa riyan nag o Octagon or PCX nalang ako sa SM Mega at Shopee.",
            "ekis lagi sakin yung mga fixer, diretso ako sa gilmore center",

            "Dapat pag pupunta jan sa Gilmore naka kunot agad noo mo tapos pag nilapitan ka, umiling ka ng pagalit. Lalayo agad sila sayo. Ganyan ginagawa ko pag nanjan ako para mag pick up ng parts sa PC Hub.",
            "nako nangyari na sakn yan langya year 2007 ounta ako don naloko ako fixer. Worth 20k na pc puro 2nd hand parts sinabi kasi daw mahal ung bago tapos pinagyayabang pa sakn specs 80gb hard drive, pentium 4 hahahaha pag dala ko ng pc sa office ambagal nastress ako sayang 20k. Buti na lang di ko pc un office pc lang. Kaya nung 2008 nung bibili na ako sarili ko pc sa bahay inaral ko lahat muna kaya pagdating ko sa shop alam ko na parts na pipiliin ko. Decent na ung core 2 duo nung time na un di ako nagsisi walang lag. Kaya tip ko aralin nyo muna ung mga parts na kelangan nyo bago punta gilmore. Mas maganda na ngayon amg resources online di ka maloloko.",
            "Matagal na ako pumunta ng Gilmore. Mga early 2000s pa ata last kong punta. Lately di na ako pumupunta dahil yung prices sa mall at ibang shops halos the same na lang. Pati sa online na rin ako madalas din bumili. Next plan ko is to buy sa PC Express sa mall na lang. Para at least walang hassle kahit medyo may dagdag ang presyo",
            "Haha same minsan higher din ang price probably because magbabayad pa sila ng rent as compared to online businesses. Na compare ko sya kaya transacted via lazada na lang. bought mine sa mega TS shop and good thing maayos naman exp ko.",
            "Before ka pmunta sa gilmore dapat prepared kna. As in scripted na, gagawin mo nalang.\n\nNakapag research kna, alam mo kung saan ppunta, may pera kna or kung cc ready na rin. \n\nPagbaba mo sa MRT never make an eye contact, ung tagos ung tingin mo sa kanila. Tpos poker face, di galit, di rin excited, dapat walang emotion. \n\nPag may sumunod sayo na makulet, wag mo pansinin mappagod rin un. \n\nTapos gawin mo na mission mo. In and out. Ganun lng. \n\nKung hindi mo alam ggawin mo, di mo alam gusto mo yari ka tlga sa kanila.",
            "Kung ako **never** na ulit ako mag-papagawa sa Gilmore. I've had a mediocre experience with gilmore. Back in 2016 bata pa ako noon so my mom wouldn't allow me to do DIY sa laptop ko baka lalo raw masira so ayun dinala namin yung laptop sa JDM Techno ng visual inspection lang sila sa laptop ko and then one of their guys dinala laptop ko sa sketchy shop sa baba ang mali namin doon hindi namin binantayan yung laptop. For HDD replacement ang tagal nagawa laptop ko mga 3 hours kami ng antay nung nagawa na baba raw kami singil ofc 3,500 OP para sakin but ok, Tapos 1 day later pag uwi ko galing school I turned on my laptop tapos 10 minutes later uminit tapos bigla namatay doon ako ng tataka baka meron pinakelaman sa motherboard ng laptop ko so ayun binalik namin ulit sa sketchy shop tinignan motherboard na raw so naka 3k ulit si mama. Mind you after that repair my laptop didn't last na a year later mas lumalala every month ngkaka motherboard issue ako na gumagastos sa repair dinadala ko nalang sa kakilala ko sa Greenhills since \"affordable\" yung sakanya compared doon sa sketchy shop. 2018 I got tired of spending my money for another repairs. My mom decided to give me her old HP laptop it was a downgrade at least may gagamitan ako. What's even worse when I bought a SATA to USB adapter I decided to check the HDD na galing sa sketchy shop 2nd hand pa nga nilagay kasi when I used recuva maraming recoverable files may mga family pictures and videos sa HDD nayun. I **wouldn't** recommend Gilmore kung takot kayo or hindi niyo alam mag DIY repair sa laptop niyo bring it somewhere else avoid gilmore avoid at all cost!",
            "For me lang po, medyo lipas na ang panahon ng Gilmore. Yung prices ng parts nila are halos pantay na vs what you'd normally see in mall-based computer stores. Gone were the days na medyo makakamura ka pa. I used to be there to satisfy my PC upgrade cravings. Pero ngayon, parang hindi na. You'd still get the parts or laptops you need, pero meron na rin sa mga malls. That also goes for repairs as well, na minsan mas maayos pa mag-approach vs the Gilmore guys.  \n\n\nAnd yes, medyo makulit sila. Better if you've already done your research bago pa man pumunta dun, kung dun ka talaga need pumunta. Treat the place like it's one big Cyberzone: lots of dizers who will ask you left and right. If you know what you're buying and where you're buying it, you can ignore them all and walk past them.",
            "Shocks. Binabayaran pala fixer. Ang alam ko yung fixers dyan are like barkers ng mga liblib na stores.\n\nBetter to save a whole day OP para mag-ikot para makahanap ka ng maayos. Nakaka-overwhelm talaga dyan if hindi ka sanay.",
            "Went there last year to have a laptop fixed due to memory management BSOD, and a PC that dies suddenly with no blue screen. They just cleaned my PC, added thermal paste and added another stick of ram, but still didn‚Äôt fix the issue. The laptop on the otherhand they just changed the SSD, windows reinstall, but didn‚Äôt fix the issue, which still occurs btw even a year after. The PC on the other hand i‚Äôve slowly upgraded and fixed the overheating issues but the random shutdowns still occur and i‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs the motherboard. (it‚Äôs an old unit that i‚Äôm upgrading on a budget as a second pc).\n\nThe shop I visited was a liquor store with 2 technicians on the side of their entrance and they had some equipment for sale there but they still buy some items from different stores. It was cramped and filled with other clients and people buying from the liquor store.\n\nThe only reason I went there was because they had on  spot parking and finding parking in gilmore is a pain in the ass. They won‚Äôt let you park there if you‚Äôre not gonna be a customer. If you‚Äôre going to gilmore, don‚Äôt bring a car. Or park in rob mag and hoof it from there.",
            "Dun ako bumili ng parts ng first PC build ko back in 2016. Hanggang ngayon gumagana pa pati GPU ko na sobrang lakas noon halos walang wala na ngayon lol. Anyway, oo huwag kang sasama sa mga fixer unless alam mo yung lugar na sinasabi nila. Kasama ko noon tatay ko kase siya nag bayad sa lahat (salamat paps). Magaling mag haggle tatay ko at wala siyang pakialam kung may ma offend siyang staff o kung sino man dun kase katwiran niya magbabayad naman siya. Kung magaling ka makipagusap, hindi magiging problema to. Experience yan nonetheless. Ingat nalang in the future.",
            "Hi! Planning to go there tomorrow, ipapaayos lang flickering screen ng laptop. Any shop recommendations? Para diretso nalang ako doon and di na ako maghanap para di mahalatang baguhan hehe. Thanks!",
            "Hahaha, ako pag anjan banat ko sa mga ninja, technician ako at me kausap na ako.\n\nMinsan pinatulan ko, sinabi ko specs ng laptop ko, pina kita sa ken mga lumang models... \"mabibilis mga yan sir\" \n\nAng layo sa need ko, sinabi ko specs ng need ko, inask budget ko... sinabi ko budget ko.\n\nSabay banat ng Ninja ng \"wala kang makukuhang ganyan\"\n\nPatola mode ako kulit e, sinagot ko ng \" Meron dalawa pa nga, ke P* C*****L at ke B****R, pwede mo ko samahan boss\"\n\nHihintay ko banat nya na \" pag me nakita ka buy mo ko 2 o 10\" ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\n\n\nEnding dedma, alis na... basta pag lalakad ka jan dpat alam mo puntahan mo, at wala lingon lingon hehehe",

Yesterday, all major 3PAs announced that they would be shutting down on the 30th of June due to these changes. There were no negotiations and Reddit refused to extend the deadlines. The rug was pulled out from under them and by extension all of the users who rely on those tools to use and/or moderate Reddit. \n\nIn addition to this, [the AMA hosted by Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/)‚Äîwhich was intended to alleviate concerns held by many users about these issues‚Äîwas nothing short of a collage of inappropriate responses. There are many things to take away from this AMA but [here are the key points](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145l7wp/todays_ama_with_spez_did_nothing_to_alleviate/). Most disappointingly it appears that Reddit outright misconstrued the actions of Apollo's creator /u/iamthatis by saying that [he threatened Reddit and leaked private phone calls](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk45rr/), something done only to clear his name of another accusation.\n\nSo what‚Äôs happening? **The TL;DR?** Effective 24 hours from the publishing of this post, **/r/PHBuildaPC will be shut down indefinitely.** In the unlikely scenario that Reddit ownership has a sudden change of heart and capitulates on their decisions, we will reopen. Until that happens, /r/PHBuildaPC will stay closed. Many other communities have come to similar decisions and we support those who have decided to take a stand.\n\n-----\n\n**Short FAQ:**\n\n**Q: Where will we go?**\n\n>I am looking into starting up an old-school forum-based solution for r/PHBuildaPC and r/PHGamers. As a self-hosted solution, the content and data contributed there will be completely self-owned (except for anything shared via offsite servers like Imgur/Facebook, of course). Development of this forum will take time. Until then, our [Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/r-phg-r-phbapc-782800744147189772) remains open to accommodate any of those who wish to continue discussing amongst the community. Discord is not the end-goal; it, too, can and will present the same or similar problems that Reddit currently poses to us. Please bear with me as I work to prepare our new home.\n\n\n**Q: Won‚Äôt Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?** \n\n>A: This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of their site is more important to them than the people who built its communities. We as a team are prepared for this; none of us want to continue to volunteer unpaid hours for a company that disrespects the people who helped build it into the front page of the Internet.\n\n\n**Q: An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?** \n\n>A: The 48-hour blackout was largely adopted as the de-facto plan by many participating subreddits, however in the original announcement we made on r/PHBuildaPC, it was left open-ended. Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn‚Äôt intend to act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors. \n\n**Q: What can we as users do to support this protest?** \n\n>A: The best way you can make your opinion known is by stopping your use of Reddit entirely. At the very least you can try and reduce your usage of the site, consider using alternatives such as [**Tildes**](https://tildes.net/) which I‚Äôve personally found to be a nice change of pace from the traditional Reddit experience. However, we realize this is a tall ask for a lot of you who also use Reddit for its other communities, research and information-gathering, and whatnot. I personally will not hold anything against anyone for staying on Reddit. You even have my blessing to create your own r/PHBuildaPC2 or r/BuildaPCPH, if you so pleased.\n\n-----\n\nThank you to everyone who has helped make /r/PHBuildaPC a special place, it was fun while it lasted. So long, and thanks for all the fish.\n\nYours in truth,  \nJP",

        "selftext": "I know this is a little bit out of topic for the sub but let me just share my experience with GeForce Now in the Philippines.  \n&nbsp;  \nin the last couple of months, I've been thinking of buying and assembling a new PC for gaming purpose. I'm a bit new to building a PC and after I found out that graphics cards are way overpriced today and may very well be for the next couple of months until next year, Ive decided to just put my project on hold until prices normalize (which I doubt it will)  \n&nbsp;  \nThat is when I stumbled upon cloud gaming. However, I was disappointed to learn that many major cloud gaming providers are either based in the US or in Europe and latency would be extremely high when I try to game in the country.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nThen I saw a Singaporian ad that GeForce now is already available in SG  via gameHub. I checked the price, performed a [ping test](https://www.cloudping.info/) and registered (you dont have to be connected to a VPN to register and play).  I was surprised on how well the service worked and played a couple of FPS and RTS without a hitch. This is my second month now and I should say I'm pretty impressed on the latency performance, reliability and speed. below is my working specs:  \n&nbsp;  \nGeForceNow Provider: [GameHubPlus SG](https://www.gamehubplus.com/geforce-now)  \nPrice: 15 SGD or 550 PHP per month for first 3 months then 20 SGD or 730 PHP per month (paid monthly).  \nInternet Provider: PLDT Fibr (80mbps)  \nLatency: 48-52ms (North Caloocan Area)  \nClient Machine: Old thinkpad T60  \nMonitor: ViewPlus 24inch 75hz  \nGaming Experience: Locked at 1080p, 60fps  \n&nbsp;  \nNow there is news that GeForce will begin to rollout RTX 1440p tier which I'm excited to try but for now, 1080p at 60 is enough for me as a casual gamer.  \n&nbsp;  \nI believe this is a good option for those who are still waiting to buy a gaming rig or just wants to try PC gaming but has limited resources.  \n&nbsp;  \nLet me know your experience with your internet provider should you decide to get onboard. Also check if your games are available [here](https://www.gamehubplus.com/geforce-now/games)\n\nGoodluck!",

            "I subscribed to their $9.99 monthly offer, and I don't see any information about price changes after 3 months. I think this may be a good time to subscribe to get good value out of the service.\n\nI am very impressed with the performance and I am here sitting in front of my mac mini m1 base model playing AAA titles without any hitch (well just a few minor issues about game settings and the fact that controllers don't seem to be supported yet).  \n\n\nGetting into the downsides:  \n1) No controller support - I tried connecting my xbox layout controller (Gamesir) and it doesn't seem to be recognized while I was playing Genshin Impact. I am not sure yet about Steam compatibility with controllers.\n\nUPDATE: Controllers are indeed supported. You just make sure to connect your gamepad before you start GeForce Now.\n\n2) Game settings get reset because of the assigned computer system rollover. I have experienced this both on GI and Steam (No Man''s Sky)\n\n3) Screen resolution is 1920x1080 - well it's probably because of my most basic subscription. You'll probably get better perks when it comes to resolution on higher pay tier, but I doubt they cater with 4k because this adds a significant weight on badwidth.  \n\n\nThe goodies:  \n1) Very low latency and decent frame rates - I wasn't expecting it to be that good but I will says it's a very reliable experience. I could even set graphcis settings to high and still have excellent experience.\n\n2) No wait time - this is only truefor paid subscriptions,but at $9.99 it's worth it IMO.  \n\n\n3) I can play on my Mac Mini M1! And I even have the base model! So this is truly novel for me, but it's made my Mac Silicon experience that much more fulfilling. \n\n4) Games that you play don't hog your PC storage space - Because the games themeselves are on the cloud, so it's a very straightforward concept.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: I am loving the experience so far. But I must admit, I do have a 700mbps download and upload ISP service. Even then as attested by others in this group, even a 100mbps rate is already a very good  experience so if you had to think about viability, I have faith in this streaming service with what we already have right now. I highly recommend it, and it helps you save up money by withholding your expenses for those gaming systems you might have been eyeing for a while now. Give this a go, it might be good for you in the lon run.",

            "I've read a little bit, do I need to buy the game if I want to use GeForce Now (except for f2p games)?",
            "Thank you for sharing your experience on this. I've been eyeing too cloud gaming since it's a lot cheaper for my case than paying upfront to buy a high-end laptop. Since I usually play in short bursts, their monthly plan suits me best. It's a delight that this is available in the Philippines -- majority of the cloud gaming companies are not supported in our country.\n\nI tried this without any VPN and it works really well! As a user with a non-gaming laptop, I am now able to experience playing games on high graphics. Also, no need to install the games on your local storage since everything's on cloud. You just need a strong and consistent internet connection to have a good cloud gaming experience. My internet is Converge with 60 Mbps plan.",
            "It has been pretty shit lately due to the undersea cable thing I think, but in general the SG Geforce Now is the shit now that my gaming laptop died and I am yet to have the money to buy myself and xbox/gamepass.",

I have over 370 games on my Steam account but seems like only 78 games (from my library) are supported on GeForce now.",
            "Nice, I will try US-West (California)\t182 ms\n\nI want to try the RTX 3080 aha and maybe it will improve the latency since it has its own 3080 tier server\n\nwill update you guys <3",

The storage, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers are salvaged from old laptops, office computers and freebies so I had a headstart in some of what I need.  I finally built it last week and it was so satisfying to have a finally workable pc! Here are the specs for those interested:\n\nMotherboard: Asus A520M-K\n\nRAM: Lexar Thor 8GB\n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 4650G\n\nPower Supply: Corsair STC500\n\nStorage: Toshiba 128GB SSD/Toshiba 1TB HDD/Seagate 512GB HDD\n\nCase: Inplay Wind 01\n\nFans: Inplay/Stock CPU fan\n\nAll of these were bought from various shops at Shopee and I used free shipping vouhers and the 1.2k discount some stores offer.\n\nOverall, I'm really satisfied with this.

Don't think about buying the 4080, 4070ti, and below. The entire Nvidia line up for this generation is nonsensical, no value for money--except the 4090. You either get the 4090 or something from AMD's lineup whether it's new or second hand. \n\nGood luck and enjoy your hard-earned 4k gaming card. Post some screen caps or record some footage so we can live vicariously through you. :)",
            "Personally I think the RTX 4090 is a good buy, assuming you can comfortably afford it and you will make the most of it by playing games at 4K, 1440p ultrawide, or with ray tracing features enabled.\n\nSome reasons why it might be a good buy:\n\n* It is the fastest GPU in the current Nvidia line-up.  Your only upgrade would be an RTX 5090 and that is rumored to be released by middle of [2025](https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-gb202-gpu-rumored-to-feature-192-sms-and-512-bit-memory-bus-according-to-kopite7kimi) which is a long way off.  So your GPU will be top dog for the next 2-3 years at least.\n* Nvidia might [temporarily halt production](https://www.custompc.com/nvidia/rtx-4000-gpu-production-stopped) of ADA Lovelace chips which means RTX 4000 prices will only get higher.  The RTX 4090 that you buy today might actually *appreciate* in price over the next 1-2 years.  Talk about high resale value.\n* The RTX 4090 performs [30% faster](https://youtu.be/l6vn6Cpd4Yc?t=906) than an RTX 4080 at 4K.  With most RTX 4080's costing well above Php 80K, an RTX 4090 priced at Php 110K has decent price-to-performance considering you are also geting 50% more VRAM.\n* With Nvidia constantly providing improvements to DLSS and introducing newer technologies like path tracing, the RTX 4090 is the perfect demo GPU.  Only the RTX 4090 is powerful enough to play games with [RTX Ultra and Path Tracing enabled](https://youtu.be/8OLE5waatRA?t=905) at 1440p and 4K.\n\nThe only downside is that problematic 12VHPWR connector which can [melt over time](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-4090-16-pin-connector-melted-after-one-year-of-usage).\n\nBut the good news is the new [12V-2x6 connector](https://youtu.be/SZPn_Jby1YQ) looks to be safer and will be included with newer ATX 3.0 PSU's [like the ones from FSP](https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qn_report/views/368868).",
            "You need to save up pa para sa 4090? Edi hindi mo talaga afford kaya ka din nahihirapan pakawalan yung pera.",
            "I would probably get the adapters from cablemod just to be safe. It's a lot of money, and you don't want it to be melting after a year.",
            "Go for 4080 if you're playing in 4K. You'll still hit 60+ FPS on max settings in 4K on most AAA titles.\n\nYou'll also have a peace of mind playing without worrying about the 4090s melting issues.",
            "OP wag kang bibili ng rtx 4090 pag yung psu mo hindi naka atx 3.0. Ang daming melted scenario sa mga included converter for 12 pins, hindi worth ng pera mo yung risk na may chance mag meltdown yung gpu mo.",
            "I would hold. 4090s are struggling with \"true\" current gen titles. Pathtracing Cyberpunk destroys it. Upcoming Unreal Engine 5 titles for sure too.",
            "What do you currently have?",

            "Good luck with the 12VHPWR connector. I've recently seen new posts here on reddit that their 1yr old 4090s just started melting even when it's plugged in securely.",

            "My rule is don't buy it if you can't buy it twice. you'd be surprised at how much you can save and end of the day, you won't fully utilize the 4090. you'd be better off at 4070 to 4080."

Take a look at the fps average on the first table using ultra settings, they're still not even enough to reach an average of 60 fps.\n\nThat tells us that there's still room for improvement on the 6500 xt, so going even lower to a 6400 is a **TERRIBLE** **DECISION.** The only way to reach a comfortable 60 fps on the 6500 xt is to run the game on med-high settings.\n\nA common mistake people make when measuring performance is looking at FPS at the surface level. 35 fps - 28 fps = 7 fps\n\nWhen you look at a 7 fps, especially if you can reach 3 digits of fps, it will look miniscule. \n\nBut if you measure the % increase instead, it's a whopping 25%.",
            "I would also **HIGHLY DISCOURAGE** anyone from getting a used rx 570 like the other commenter said, he's recommending a GPU based on the extremely slim chance that they'll need H.264/H.265 encoding. Remember that they can still use CPU encoding, sure you can't use Quick Sync without an iGPU but raw CPU power can still encode. As far as decoding goes, it's still supported so you won't have any worries with playback. \n\nTake note, **encoding ‚â† 2d/3d rendering**. H.264/H.265 are purely video coding formats and are not synonymous with the likes of output generated within apps like Photoshop/Maya/Blender. You can still 2d/3d render using the 6500 xt\n\nYou'll only have to worry about H.264/H.265 encoding if you're actually a video editor rendering out in those video formats. And as I've previously mentioned, the CPU (in this case the i3 12100f) can still encode at those video coding formats without both a GPU (hardware-accelerated support) or iGPU (Quick Sync). \n\nIf you're getting an RX 570 just for the sake of H.264/H.265 encoding, you must have a professional job as a video editor and have to encode every single day to make this purchase worth your while.\n\nFor anyone even considering this, let me tell you of the few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. The RX 570 is a half decade-old card. What does this mean? It means the RX 570s you see laying around have been used for 1-5 years. Some of the cards you'll be purchasing might not even be from the original owner and was passed around frequently.\n2. There was (still is but not compared to back then) a mining craze these past few years, be prepared for a high change of getting a card that was used for that very purpose. Also assume that some of the boat-load of GPUs from the China mining ban is already in circulation here.\n\nDue to the points above, be prepared for potentially getting a card with:\n\n1. Dried out compound that you'll have to have the knowledge of replacing, not to mention spending more for the compound.\n2. More coil whine and worn out fans from mining.\n3. A repaired GPU, which can vary from a simple capacitor change on the card to a full-blown reballing that would eventually result in the problem appearing again in the future.\n4. No warranty\n5. Higher TDP\n6. Less performance (don't get fooled by the benchmarks online, **A LOT** of them used the 6500 xt on a pcie 3.0, try to look for benchmarks that uses pcie 4.0 and you can see the obvious performance difference. Also don't pay too much attention to the stuttering in the videos, most of the time it's a recording problem, refer to the comments section and you can usually see the author explaining those things).",

I can imagine the profit margins will be pretty thin for Shopee and its sellers - there's no way it's sustainable.\n\nSeems to me it's just a kneejerk reaction when Lazada started matching their discounts. I would've thought however that they'll eventually just revert to their usual 10% daily vouchers, with the occasional 15% once-a-month events and payday sales.\n\nThat said, are there any consequences for merchants refusing to shoulder part of the discount?

I would not blame people for saying this a countless times in this sub, **** is a bad card I would recommend saving more for RX 6600. It only means that RX 6600 is the only decent brand new u will only see for that specific price range.\n\nSo, if you want a GPU, it's either you will buy a second hand GPU. And some are still reasonably skeptical to 2nd hand. But because the performance gains oughweights the risk of buying it and also the fact that people are also proving that used GPUs are fine and not as bad as it seems. Which is a good thing, actually.\n\nThe only thing that is sad is that we lack decent brand new GPU budget options rn in the brand new market.

They should not process / accept your payment until it's confirmed they have a unit in stock reserved for you.  Dumb I know, but that's the problem with shops having a separate inventory area and not have some tracking system to see what items they have in stock.\n\n*BTW that issue also happens with rogue staff that sell items on their own / under the table and don't record the sale.  The store suddenly realizes that there is less stock on hand for unknown reasons.*\n\nAlso if the store really wanted to scam you with the ASUS DUAL, they would not say it is open box and will keep quiet about it.  If you see that the box is opened they can easily say that they needed to open the box to apply the distro sticker (which is a normal thing).\n\nAt least you got your refund which is a good thing.  But I would not put too much credit on the shop using scamming tactics in general.  \n\nIt's most probably the inventory guy desperate to having the ASUS DUAL GPU sold, as he might have opened it prematurely by mistake.

        "selftext": "i know there r a lot of college students here like me who just built/will build their own pcs and this post will sound like a flex, but im tryna help‚Äì\n\nive recently built my own [desktop](https://ibb.co/yhLdMyW) and its going good for about 2 weeks now. the total for the essentials is Php 20 600 which is pretty reasonable for a school/workstation/light gaming pc that can last for 5+ years (if u r a student, dont aim for a pc that can play AAA games unless u r rich lmao). for the monitor, use ur flat screen tvs (which i did) or look for cheap branded 2nd hands.\n\nbought everything on physical stores except for the processor cus cpus hardly fail. if u do buy online, choose shopee mall/lazmall for discounts on 7.7. but as much as possible canvass well on stores near you so that in cases that u need to return a defective item, u can easily reach them for RMA. and when buying, ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS, ITS FREE\n\nthe bottom part of the list is pretty optional, but if u focus on the essential part: U CANT FIND A PRE-BUILT SYSTEM LIKE THIS. i cant stress this enough but please dont fall for prebuilts. they r just mixing garbage parts with a decent processor to make the system look cool. ALWAYS READ COMMENTS FROM PC FACEBOOK GROUPS TO LEARN.\n\nALSO, DONT FALL FOR RGBS. \nUSE PSUs with 80+ RATING. DONT FALL FOR \"TRUE RATED\"\n\nin my quest to build my own pc, ive decided to man-up and assemble it on my own. heres another tip: choose intel if u r afraid of pins (im afraid of pins). amd apus are better than intels but man, i almost cried when my build didnt boot up. turns out i just needed to insert the cpu power properly. another pro tip: its easier to replace a motherboard than a Php9000 cpu, consider this when u r afraid of pins or its ur 1st time building.\n\n\"aight OP thats cool and all, but how about the money?\" \nFIRST, u r a student and u probably have skills so earn from that. im kinda good with math so i took advantage of it by pitching my services to my rich friends who r taking non-math courses (protip: befriend/establish connections with rich students. connections pay well in the future). i would answer their activities, quizzes, and exams in exchange for money. \n\nSECOND, sell things. while i was still living in baguio (i moved to batangas for free tuition), i sold lemons for Php5/pc. lemons are kinda indemand and we had plenty of them so earning from them wasnt so hard, just be masipag to carry them to buyer's house. u can sell clothes but profits are slow. remember supply and demand when selling things\n\nTHIRD, watch out for free money from congressman's/mayor's office, announcements say its 'scholarship' but in reality its just unallocated dswd funds they need to release. they do these 2-3x per year so photocopy ur credentials. \n\nFOURTH, if u r living alone and on a monthly Php6k allowance like me, cut costs. i started saving in june 2021 and i manage my daily food by eating 7slices of bread for mornings and 2 rice meals for 1 day. when night comes, i only turn on 1 light. use electric fan only at peak of the day and when sleeping. minimize fan use whenever possible. Php11/kwh is too much. i mananged to save about Php500-1.5k per month from this. the point is, whenever money reaches ur hands, think of ur pc. \n\ni still have money left from savings but its not enough for a 3060/ti so I'll just settle for uhd 630 atm\n\nThis post is kinda long and messy but my message is: kung gusto, may paraan. \n\nIf u r confused on something, just drop ur question, if u wanna add something, do it. the goal is to help our fellow students.\n\nTLDR: It pays to read pc building/assembling related posts and comments. As for the money, monetize ur skills and look out for free money whenever possible.",

On top of that, mga isang taon lang siya nagamit. Nag-drop yung price halos same sa RX6600 na 8k-9k average sa used market.  \n\nChecked the receipt and 21k nya nabili nung January 2023 si RTX 3060, kasama pa sa resibo yung items sa build nya.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone.\n\nI just want to tell my experience as a foreigner who needed a computer and ended up building my own. Maybe this post may serve another foreigner to make his own decision if needed.\n\n\nMy trusted Thinkpad died from falling down on the floor and so I was out of a computer. \nThe first days I enjoyed not spending time with my computer and instead have my mind focus on other things, like getting back into training martial arts. \nBut after a week I was feeling frustrated that my itch to be creative and make my own tattoo design wasn‚Äôt possible. Looking back I should just have bought an IPad and used procreate but I wasn‚Äôt thinking like that I was thinking I needed to use my regular software again on my computer so I went out to buy a Lenovo legion. And this was when I learned that Philippines have some one the most expensive imports wtf. I was not gonna give 120.000 nor 144.000 pesos for a laptop that should cost 100.000P. \nSo I went online and looked on Facebook and had sat up a deal to buy a used Thinkpad only for that person to try and change the price higher as the days went on. This was the point where I was just fed up and decided to build my own. I used Bermor tech and I called them to ask about if I could have it delivered with flight. The customer service just hanged up on me twice while I spoke to them. So I emailed them and they responded. \nI had  another question so I called again and the guy just hanged up when I was speaking English. So I needed a girl to call for me and talk with them. \n\nAnyway I made my order of around 120.000pesos for a Small form factor PC with a 7950x cpu that was to be used for 3D modeling and design. \nAnd I waited. After 2 weeks with no updates on my order I have the same girl call them and they tell her the PSU was not to be send and they was waiting for shipment of a new one that would arrive in 10 days. \nSo somehow they know this PSU is defect even though after I purchased it the girl was on the phone conforming with them every single piece was in warehouse to be send. \n\nThis was the second issue. \nThe third issue is that instead of contacting me or upgrading my PSU I was just to wait 3 weeks with no contact from them else. \n\nSo I tell them to send it it flight and just get it all packed and rewire the money for the PSU.\nSo two weeks later I received it and it‚Äôs send with ship instead. Even though I paid for flight. \n\nAnyway I never saw my money for the PSU so 2 months later the girl calls and ask about it and they would send it same day. 1 month later she calls and ask why they keep wasting my time and why they keep my money and finally they send it. \n\nI bought the PSU in a store in the mall and I had such a good experience and a great talk with the guy. This guy in the mall really restored my faith in customer service so my take on this whole experience if you can spare to spend 10-15K extra just buy all you need from the stores and go home with it same day, or buy from Amazon if the parts are under 10K. I can‚Äôt recommend buying online from a Filipino store. But I highly recommend buying from a physical store. \nAlso don‚Äôt bother buying from Facebook. ",

            "DynaQuest PC is very reliable and their prices seem competitive. I have been using them for years now. In my last PC build, I ordered the parts from their Lazada shop - everything except the white CoolerMaster AIO (they only had it in black). Everything arrived with no damages and I was able to assemble the PC with no issues.",
            "Buying from a physical store is the safest. But it's only easy if you live near a good one (Gilmore, etc). I live near the LRT line running through Gilmore but I have not been there since pre-pandemic. The case and the PSU are the two items you would want to buy from a physical store (first). \n\nIf you know how to assemble from parts or know someone who does, you can buy individual components from the same stores through Shopee and Lazada. I agree Facebook market is risky but it gives you an idea what's available locally. I haven't bought anything from FB. Before picking a part, I check out the reviews on YT. Pluses for buying from Shopee and Lazada are the discounts. After buying a component, you can apply the coins earned on the next purchase. \n\nYou can buy hard to get parts from Amazon. It's free shipping for orders over US$40 but import taxes kick in for orders over 10000Php and added to the order price. I bought a couple of 2TB NVMe drives and a 48GB DDR5 pair. 48GB was just under the 10K limit. It took 2-3 weeks to arrive at my door.",

            "That's why either you build it yourself or go to a physical store. Customer support is trash here as a native myself and had more faith on amazon support than my local online shop to have my order instantly replaced or refunded",
            "Damn I used bermor to buy my PC. And they were relatively straight forward with me and even helped foresee issues that I couldn't have anticipated (I was buying a itx case with a m-atx mobo). Delivery took less than a week and I didn't need to do anything else. But this and the comments makes me second guess them if I should recommend them to friends.",
            "I sell PC's and PC parts (province) and I source some of my orders from EasyPC. They're slightly more expensive than the others by a few hundred pesos, but from experience the past 5 years they have had 100% delivery no issues. Have ordered from Bermor at least twice I think and I remember a case that my customer build was very specific with many years ago, it arrived on time no problem.\n\nFor building PC's in the Philippines it's sometimes better to walk-in on a PC shop. Slightly more expensive but face-to-face Filipinos are generally friendly and easy to talk to so that's what I guess is what you're paying extra for. Plus you can walk back in if there are any issues with it."

        "selftext": "The purpose of this post is to help other buyers decide if Bermor is a good potential store for them to purchase PC parts online.\n\n====================================\n\n**July 27 @ 12PM Saturday:** Bago mag check out, nagchat muna ako sa staff through their chat system to double check if meron ba talaga yung items nila kasi I read somewhere in this sub na minsan outdated daw yung stock availability na nakasulat sa site. Waited <5 mins and the staff rep informed me that all parts were available. He also informed me that some of my parts were incompatible and even gave some recommendations.\n\nAfter that, nag proceed to check out na ako. Many payment options offered but I think bank transfer is the best option. Credit cards have 3k \"Transaction Insurance\" fee, and Maya and Gcash have around 1.5k  fee. Bank transfer has a .5% discount and a significantly lower insurance fee (800 pesos I believe). May patong shipping fee rin of 1.5k for my parts.\n\nAfter mag check out & place ng order, may lalabas na instructions on how to pay for the order. Sasabihin na need mo iscreenshot yung deposit slip/transaction slip and send sa email nila with the email header as the Order # given to you after checking out, and then notify them via chat.\n\n====================================\n\n**July 27 @ 1PM Saturday:** Dito dumating first bad experience ko. Not sure kung lunch break nila or busy, pero it took 1:30 hrs before the same rep finally replied to me and acknowledged the email. He said to kindly wait while they verify the payment.\n\n**July 27 @ 4PM Saturday**: Waited 3 more hours before sending them a follow-up on the verification. According to the rep, usually payment verifications are done within 30mins-2hours, pero since it's the weekend daw expect delays because of limited bank operations on weekends.\n\n====================================\n\n**July 28 @ 12AM Sunday:** Since gising pa ako ahaha I decided to refresh my orders page sa website nila. Nag update na yung order ko from **On-hold** to **Processing** with a new message below saying my proof of payment has been received at 12:20AM.\n\n====================================\n\n**July 29 @ 10AM Monday:** New update on the orders page stating \"Order received.\"\n\n**July 29 @ 2PM Monday:** Staff informed me that my cooler was out of stock despite the website stating the stock was available + requested the staff to double check the availability of stocks before checkout. sigh. But the staff was hasty to provide me alternatives. Had to replace CPU Cooler & Motherboard. Very annoying kasi I already spent hours researching each part tas biglang papalitan.\n\n====================================\n\n**July 31 @ 7PM:** Order page updated with \"Package arrived at (x) Sorting Hub\" with LBC tracking order so you can track it on the LBC site.\n\n====================================\n\n**Aug 2 @ 11AM:** LBC tracking page updated to \"Expect delivery within the day\". (CAR Region ako). Parts came in 1 huge package (PC parts + case + monitor), very well packed naman and nothing was damaged. Built the PC after 6 hours (yes lol) and everything worked perfectly.\n\n====================================\n\n**August 12:** Nag tanong sa chat system for updates sa refund. Sabi daw iuupdate ako as soon as possible and iuupdate finance team nila.\n\n====================================\n\n**August 16:** Nagsend ulit ng message itong 7PM (message will be processed tomorrow since hanggang 5/6pm lang chat service nila). Wala pa ring refund received and will probably escalate to DTI if hindi nila maprocess bukas.\n\n====================================\n\n**August 17:** Nagreply staff rep at inupdate order ko with **Refund Reference Number** tas sabi ulit na hintayin magreflect ang refund sa account. Not sure exactly kung kelan sila nagstart ng processing but around hapon finally narefund na at dumating yung excess payment ko sa bank.\n\n====================================\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* many options compared to my local stores, many parts ranging from many different well-known brands\n* good prices\n* optionally they can build the PC for a fee\n* budget and expensive parts available\n* easy navigation and filter settings on the website\n* website PC builder (still highly recommend PC Part Picker to see actual compatibility of pc parts to each other)\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* long payment verification time\n* long time to get all parts ready for shipment (for some parts they get it from other branches/stores?)\n* stock availability on the website sometimes outdated\n* terrible payment system. You have to pay first then wait for them to verify the payment before they start collecting parts & shipping. During that time the pc parts you chose might've already been processed by earlier orders which means you will have to find new parts. Also, you have to manually show them proof of payment and send an email. And if unfortunately the items you picked became out of stock, you have to process a refund, which according to them can take 7-14 days to process.\n* Took 22 days to get my excess payment refund after reminding staff through chat. \n\nOverall rating: 3/5 because of the payment process & refund hassle.

Filed a complaint to DTI\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just gonna enumerate the timeline similar dun sa isang post about TechMovers.\n\n**March 25 (Sat):** Placed order and payed for Motherboard and CPU thru their website. They replied and informed me na they will \"verify the payment and please wait for the update until tomorrow\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**March 26:** Nag follow up ako sa verification ng payment, na follow up na daw nila sa finance team and verification will be later that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**March 28:** Payment verified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 3:** I asked for an update, sabi nila nasa \"custom ph\" na for clearing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 5:** I asked for an update, automated reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 6:** I asked for an update, automated reply again\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 11:** Pleaded for an update, sabi nila nasa *\"custom ph\"* na po yung package, then later updated na-deliver na yung items sa warehouse nila. At 5:53 pm, pwede na daw ipick up yung item sa kanila.\n\nBooked a courier, received the items by 7pm. Nag proceed na ako mag build immediately. The PC did not POST but it did turn on (GPU lights, case fans and cpu fans).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 12:** Further diagnostics, still not posting. I messaged them kung nag ddiagnostics sila ng hardware kasi baka defective yung motherboard or CPU (doubtful) nila. They asked questions, like if i updated to latest bios. I told them \n\n*\"I built everything last night po. It wouldnt post/boot so i waited until this morning. No signs of booting. I already tried the qflash to update bios, reseat cpu, ram and gpu multiple times. Cleared cmos\"*\n\nThey asked the full specs, after ko isend, no reply na.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 13:** I asked kung irereplace ba nila yung unit and gaano katagal. They will follow up daw. Im still doing test at that point\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 14:** I tested a working RAM and still did not work, yun lang yung test na pwede ko gawin kasi wala ako ibang motherboard or cpu to test.\n\nI told them na most likely yung motherboard yung may issue, and ask if they can test it.  Asked for replacement policy or refund policy. *\"we will contact the technician\"* ang reply.\n\nI asked if they will replace or refund. No answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 15 (Sat)**: I asked if they have contacted the technician. I told them na ill drop off the items including cpu sa warehouse nila that coming monday. No reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 17:** I went to their warehouse/pickup location and met the CEO, handed him the items and asked him to sign a waiver of receipt. He also informed me na 7days ang replacement (I guess after testing??)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 19:** asked for an update, kung napatest na sa technician nila. They replied *\"we will follow this up po, medyo busy lang po technician namin\".*\n\nI told them that i need the replacement, before May sana, and if they cant replace, pwedeng refund na lang.  Naka follow up na daw sa marketing team nila\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 20:** I asked for an update, sabi nila *\"tinetest pa po siya sir,\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 21:** I asked for an update, no reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 22 (Sat):** I asked for an update, sabi nila \"ongoing pa po yung testing sir, we will update po agad kapag meron na po update sa technician\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 24:** I asked for an update, automated reply\n\n**April 25:** I asked for an update, automated reply again\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 26:** I asked for an update, they're still testing. I told them na i prefer REFUND na lang, wag na ireplace kasi sobrang tagal naman, sayang kasi yung time if ever defective ulit yung replacement unit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**April 28:** I asked for an update, no reply for hours. then I asked for their phone number and they immediately replied. I asked again for update and they said \n\n*\"kinakausap na po ng boss namin yung warehouse po regarding po sa motherboard niyo sir. tsaka po sa warranty\"*\n\nOk naman daw yung processor so I asked them kung pwedeng irefund ko na lang yung motherboard. Still being tested by technician and they will follow up sa marketing team nila.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 1:** I asked for an update, automated reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 2:** I asked for an update, follow up daw sa finance team nila, may problem daw sa bank.\n\nI asked kung pwede na ba i-pickup yung CPU since working naman sya. Also asked if CPU is included with the refund and when will they refund. no reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 3:** I asked for an update at 10 am, they replied 6:21 pm and the technician asked some questions. I immediately replied. No reply after that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May 4:** I asked for an update about refund and CPU, no reply.\n\nI told them later that day *\"Hello, please po wag na natin paabutin ng 1 month itong issue na ito. I hope you understand\".* \n\nKausap daw nila technician, and asked me to please wait. I asked for an update after 30\\~mins\n\nThey told me *\"medyo busy lang kasi yung technician namin lately kaya po mabagal po yung update\"*\n\nI told them *\"Sorry sa abala Pasensya na po, sorry talaga\"* s/\n\nthey apologized for the delay.\n\nI asked for an update at 6pm, no reply\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry sobrang haba, this took me too long to write. Sobrang frustrated na ako sa kanila. I am, 25k less and still no PC upgrade. Naka tenga lang yung investment ko sa kanila. Items are legit and they have good prices for sure but I don't think this service/shop is worth the risk or recommendable at all, especially if you value customer service and customer support. \n\nI already filed a complaint sa DTI, hopefully it speeds up the process.

        "selftext": "If you are going to stream netflix at 1440p resolution or 4k Netflix requires the monitor to have HDCP 2.2 or else it won't play at your desired resolution. This HDCP specification is indicated on the monitor's manual. I had a philips monitor before that can play videos at higher resolution since it had HDCP 2.2. Additionally, if you have a secondary monitor that is not HDCP 2.2 compliant, video resolutions will still be stuck at 1080p. All cables connected should be compliant.\n\nHigh-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a copyright protection scheme, where all components in the video signal should adhere to this standard, or else video quality gets degraded or worse not play videos.\n\nI bought a Xiaomi 34\" and when it came I can only play movies with a 1080p resolution. I reached out to the support team but they said they can't help me since it is listed on the product description (fair enough). However, it is such a niche requirement that I don't blame myself for this.\n\nI looked into the availability of HDCP bypassing by using an hdmi splitter, but it is too costly and only available on amazon. It would cost me atleast 2000 pesos for it, additionally with the possibility of it not working.\n\nIf anyone has encountered this issue and has a fix using local parts I would thank you greatly. I asked for all the shops here in ph if they can do HDCP bypass however, I don't think they can ever say that since there may be moral/legal stuff in that. Basically all shops here say they don't support HDCP bypassing.\n\nIronically, I can just fix this issue by pirating movies rather than going the legal way. HDCP is such a PITA for the consumer side and it never addresses the issue of piracy.",

It is also a separate device so you can even turn off your PC while watching Netflix and just use the remote.\n\nPersonally I think buying a separate media player device that can stream 4K Netflix is better than buying that HDMI splitter, which also does not guarantee Netflix will stream at 4K HDR.\n\nAnother option is to use the Nvidia DSR route which seems to work even on 1440p ultrawide like what is mentioned in the article.",

Motherboard - there's a lot but if he doesn't have anything specific, ask reddit as it relates to the CPU he's going to use.\n5. PSU - He probably has one in mind.

If meron man RX 6600, nasa 10-11k pa din. Even PhilKor wala na din used GPUs na around 10k.\n\nAno kaya ang best option ko? Parang nahihinaan ako sa RX 6600 lalo na kung 13-14k ang babayaran ko. ",

Should be around 14-15k. 1660ti to rx 6600 is approximately around 30% performance uplift only.",

One of Worthy Upgrades official partner suppliers, TechMovers, was really cool to give Worthy Upgrades' clients exclusive prices.\n\nFeel free to drop a DM on our [Facebook](https://bit.ly/WorthyUpgrades-Facebook) page for inquiries. Or just leave a reply in this thread, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm usually active between 3PM-3AM, weekdays.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n* These need to be bought along with a pre-ordered built-to-order system unit. For DIY builders that just need the APU itself, I believe only regular prices apply, slide by their DMs on [their Facebook page](https://bit.ly/TechMovers-Facebook) for inquiries and tell them we sent you! :)\n* Lead times are usually within one week (as fast as four days) when all parts are sourced locally/no items are sourced from TechMovers. Usually 10-14 days when there are parts sourced from them, even for the Ryzen 5000 series APUs!\n* Services are currently available within Metro Manila only. Operations in Pampanga are currently paused since my PC buddy that handles the operations there got accepted for a full time work and I'm now waiting for someone to take his place."

        "title": "Took our chances on a mining gpu and lost the lottery.",
        "selftext": "A friend of mine took his chances on a mining Gigabyte RTX 3070 sold on fb marketplace and he was not that lucky. He understands that there are risks on buying a gpu used from mining before he bought one. I was the one who procured the card for him. The seller and I tested the card, run benchmarks and heaven and made sure it runs stable before paying. The seller is actually quite nice. He even let me in his room so we can test the card in his personal rig.\n\nMy friend used the gpu for four gaming sessions (we only play warzone and he mostly plays on weekends). On his 4th gaming session, his PC suddenly turned off on our first battleroyale. He smelled burnt electric parts, so he said he is probably done for the night. \n\nHe checked his pc and we were trying to figure out what was wrong in his PC. He then went on and tested and found that some of the pins on one of the two 8-pin pcie socket of the gpu are grounded (he used a multimeter). Whenever he tries to turn his pc power ON, The CPU fan will run for a split second and will then turn off. Odd. \n\nHe said something is tripping the safety feature of the PSU. That is his first idea. I thought it was his PSU. Im not very familiar with the PSU he is using. Still, I figured he got a clue what's going on. He's a licensed engineer anyway, and he works for a big industrial power supply manufacturer. So I'm quite certain he knows. We were just laughing on the fact that his 4th gaming session coincidentally matched the number \"4\" label written on his mining gpu. (written with a sharpy) We thought the gpu is only good for four gaming sessions and then self destructs. üòÖ\n\nWe understand that the seller is not obligated to replace the gpu since he only gives \"7 days warranty\" and it has been almost a month when we purchased the card. But we did contact the seller anyway, just to try our luck (again).\n\nThe seller had the same idea like mine and asked what psu did we use with the gpu. When I told him that my friend was using an Enermax Revobron 700w, he mentioned right away that it is a \"generic power supply\". I understand that the psu is not as known as most A tier powersupply brands, however, it has a good review on tegcpowerup that warrants my friend's hunch that his PSU is fine.\n\n[Enermax Revobron 700w](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/enermax-erb700awt/)\n\nI suggested hooking up my seasonic gm650 on his pc just to rule out the PSU suspicion, His PC performed the same behavior, turned on for a split second then shutdown. So we figured the powersupply was not the issue.\n\nNext, I suggested hooking up my palit 3070 on his PC using his enermax PSU. It turned on. He even played warzone just to see if my gpu will explode.... it didnt... hehe....\n\nSo we decided that since we will never get a refund, we might as well open the gpu and see what happened. one of the black parts inside was burnt. According to google, its the part where the vram is? Im not quite sure, but definitely something blew up in there.\n\nI ended up selling my gpu to him and I continued his quest and bought a secondhand rtx 3080 (not from mining... as far as i know...). üòÇ\n\nNow, the GPU is just an expensive paperweight. üòÖ We knew the risks, played with luck, and we lost. My Palit rtx 3070 jetstream is still working up to this day. If the gpu i sold to my friend should blow up as well in the near future, I'll update this post and let you all guys know.\n\nMy story ends here. I hope you guys learned a thing or two from our experience. Lesson here is, there is nothing for certain when buying used gpus. If you want them cheap, there will always be risks. If you want peace of mind, buy brand new. üëåüèæ",

I then sell them before the warranty ends and if there are any issues encountered on the new machine, they can rma it themselves.

He also has a discord link where you can contact him.",

        "title": "Welcome to r/PHbuildapc!",
        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nIf you're looking for advice, information, or inspiration on building your own PC in the Philippines, this is it! r/PHbuildapc is a community dedicated to custom PC assembly specifically in the Philippines. Anyone is welcome to seek the input of our helpers as they piece together their desktop, or decide on a laptop.\n\nSome guidelines to get started:\n\n* Before you begin participating in the subreddit, we ask that you take a look at our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHbuildapc/wiki/rules). \n* We have weekly megathreads for simple questions like: \"Is this RAM compatible with this mobo?\", \"Which sub-‚Ç±15k GPU should I get?\", or \"What's a good ergo chair?\" Please ask such questions there instead of on the subreddit frontpage, to keep clutter down to a minimum.\n* Many subreddit guidelines can be found in our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHbuildapc/wiki/index).\n* [PinoyPCBuilder.com](https://pinoypcbuilder.com/) is a good resource to get started on making a partlist for your build. I've already requested the site's creators to add an \"export in markdown\" feature that will make it easier to share on Reddit, but until then, lists from this site will be accepted in post bodies.\n* We have a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jzvqbvaptc), feel free to join and chat about a wider variety of topics than what this subreddit allows.\n\nIf you're going to post a build help topic on the subreddit frontpage, keep in mind that **getting good answers requires asking a good question**.  The best way to ask a question is to cover the following explicitly.  You don't have to write a novel, but try to provide sufficient context for people to help you.\n\n1. What are your concerns?  Why are you asking a question here?  There's no bad reasons, but tell people what YOUR reason is and you're more likely to get an answer that helps you.\n2. What are you trying to DO with your computer?  There is no \"best\" computer, only \"the best at...[something]\"  Common answers include \"playing games\" or \"processing data\" or \"work from home\" but don't assume that your use case is broadly understood.  What kind of games?  How much data?  What applications do you use for work? Etc.  If you're doing something graphically intense, **Include the details of your intended display**, specifically the resolution and target framerates.\n3. What is your budget?  Every build has a budget.  Maybe you're a baller that thinks \"sky's the limit\" but you will probably be surprised just how high that sky is.  Telling people up front what you are willing to spend will allow people to do more effective tradespace management (save a bit here and spend more there).  Alternatively, they can help give you realistic expectations.\n4. What environmental constraints or priorities do you have?  Want to keep a good upgrade path for the future?  That's important.  Needs to last 10 years?  Don't have good ventilation?  Need to be quiet in a dorm room?  Need to mount the PC somewhere?  Got low power?  Concerned about data integrity?  Say it up front as those considerations can radically change recommendations.\n5. What else have you considered and written off and why?  Other people don't know what you've been thinking, or why those solutions aren't right for you, so tell them. Common ones include \"I already have some pieces\" or \"application X has problems with Y configuration\" or \"I just want to do X and not Y.\"  (There's no shame in having preferences)\n\nThis and many other frequently asked questions are covered in our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHbuildapc/wiki/index/faq) wiki entry.\n\nAside from all that, I ask for your understanding if in the early days the moderation for the sub is all over the place; it will take a while to get a feel for the community's collective personality, and we will adjust on the fly. Speaking of mods, if you'd like to be one, we're taking volunteers. These are the qualifications:\n\n>The basic qualifications are a willingness to learn the reddit mod tools (really easy once you practice with it for like 1 hour), diligence in checking/evaluating posts that need attention, and using Reddit pretty often (10-20 mins every 6 hours, preferred). Mod duties, of communities our size anyway, adds about 5 minutes to your Reddit use if on desktop. On mobile it takes longer because there are no mobile apps with decent mod tools, I've found.\n>\n>English and Tagalog proficiency of course, because that's what people in our subreddit post in.\n>\n>Being able to keep a cool head in case someone disputes your moderation decision. We've had a couple users really complain so hard about some post removals or temporary bans. Usually I handle these because I don't want rules that I decided on stressing out the people who volunteer to help mod.\n>\n>And of course, being able to come to your decisions as a mod autonomously, impartially, and without exception. If you see something that clearly is against subreddit rules, or Reddit rules as a whole, you should be able to reprimand the offenders appropriately.\n\nIf you're eager to give it a shot, [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/PHbuildapc) with a short intro of yourself to get started and we'll take it from there.\n\nEnough talk, have at thee!\n\nYour mod, tech support, and best friend,  \nJP",

            "Update: the parts arrived 2 days ago and installation was smooth other than flashing bios which was also super easy if only i didnt lost my flash drives weeks ago. I ended up buying new flashdrive to update my bios which was as easy as setting the files and pressing a button. I was able to finish the cpu, mobo and ram swap in around 3hrs. The mounting of cpu cooler was quite a handful since ryzen series now uses screws instead of clips like my 10 yr old athlon. Its an awesome experience. The bios of MSI was also overwhelming since I was more acclimated with the blue and white bios of early 2000s. Hahahaha. The 5600 is a beast. With upto 4.3 ghz turbo and a stock clock speed of 3.5. I ended up tuning the cpu using the ryzen software to tame the beast as it was overheating at 95c while doing a stress test. I thought it was the way i mounted the cooler so i tried reseating it the next day and to no avail its still overheats, it turns out when PCB is on, it can get pretty hot with only the stock cooler. \n\nTakeaways:\n1 beready to flash your bios if you are ordering online. A lot of instructions in yt and other forums just follow it as it can be very easy rather than going to a technician. \n2. Check your temps. If its running hot check the pcb if its on, its a pretty good cpu on stock settings. \n3. Aftermarket cpu coolers are better when overclocking or just by tuen on the pcb. \n4. Its an awesome experience. If you are low on funds, just order the key parts you need you can just upgrade it later.\n5. If you will reuse your old os boot drive, change bios settings from uefi to csm so you can boot to OS if you are having a hard time booting OS just like me.\n\nGod bless and goodluck on your future builds",

Bought one in Amazon for Php 3,130.34 free shipping  + $5 coupon (pamigay ni Amazon) last May 10, and I just received it today, May 16. Napakamahal ng mga binebenta locally kasi. Bermor comes to mind as a cheaper alternative locally, pero mas mura pa din sa Amazon even without the 5USD coupon.\n\nSwitched out my XPG to the 970, booted a USB with Win 10 LTSC, partitioned the drive and went ahead with the installation. Wala pang 10mins ok na. Natagalan lang ako sa pag install ng mga software utilities.\n\nXPG will be my new Proxmox OS drive hopefully for longer than 5yrs",

Anyway, OP, as long as you contacted Amazon and they are aware of the concern, you are eligible for either a replacement or a refund. Granted, that does not take away the frustration of having waited so long for your order only to find out that something terrible happened along the way. Notify NinjaVan lang and give them the tracking number. And if the expected window for delivery hae reached and nothing has happened, Amazon can process a replacement for you. \n\nOff-topic but my TeamGroup T-Force Delta Tuf Gaming Alliance RAM was suddenly \"Undeliverable\" just 2 hours ago, which pisses me off. I ordered last Black Friday for a really good deal. *Sigh. I got frustrated and just told Amazon to give me a refund because I hate having to wait this long for my item only to be cancelled or \"undeliverable\".

I contacted the seller on Shopee (Segotep), who kept redirecting me to their distributor (Ipason) without resolving anything. After trying to file a refund and hitting a limit on requests, Shopee support rejected my claim for \"lack of evidence\" even though I‚Äôd provided everything, including the waybill. When I asked for clarification and re-sent proof, Shopee stopped responding entirely.\n\n  \nWHAT HAPPENED:  \nI bought a GN650W power supply advertised as having four PCI-E connectors, but it only came with two. I reached out to the seller, @ segotepphilippines on Shopee, explaining the issue and requesting a replacement before leaving a review. They directed me to [ipason.ph](http://ipason.ph), their distributor, which matched the name on my receipt. However, every time I contacted Segotep on Shopee, they kept redirecting me to Ipason, and I had to guide the conversation myself to clarify the issue, as if they were intentionally avoiding a resolution.\n\nEventually, they suggested I file a refund through Shopee. Not realizing there was a three-request limit, I tried to \"edit\" my request multiple times, which ended up canceling it. After that, I contacted Shopee support, and they filed on my behalf, but it was rejected. A second attempt through support also went nowhere. After a week's break to clear my head, I tried again, but by then the seller insisted only Shopee could help, while Shopee claimed I hadn‚Äôt provided enough evidence.\n\nThe seller then stated that because the order status was \"completed,\" I could no longer request a refund. Instead, they suggested I \"upgrade\" by buying a different model, effectively making me pay more. Fed up, I went back to Shopee support, asking what evidence they specifically needed to approve my request. They said they needed the waybill, which I had already provided. I re-sent a screenshot showing the waybill from a video, but now Shopee has stopped responding altogether.\n\nthere are more to this in the drive link i provided.",

Medyo kasi nakakalito, ang reference ko ay yun akin na binili na psu yun coolermaster mwe v2 650w dalawa ang pcie connector nun apat lahat ang cable for gpu. \nAnyways, saan mo naman gagamitin yun apat na pcie connector?"
